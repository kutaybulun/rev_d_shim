# Trigger Core (`shim_trigger_core`)

The `shim_trigger_core` module provides flexible trigger management for the Rev D shim firmware..

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

- `clk`, `resetn`: Main clock and active-low reset.
- `cmd_word [31:0]`: Command word from buffer.
- `cmd_buf_empty`: Indicates if command buffer is empty.
- `ext_trig`: External trigger signal.
- `dac_waiting_for_trig [7:0]`: DAC channels waiting for trigger.
- `adc_waiting_for_trig [7:0]`: ADC channels waiting for trigger.
- `data_buf_full`, `data_buf_almost_full`: Data buffer status.

### Outputs

- `cmd_word_rd_en`: Enables reading the next command word.
- `trig_out`: Trigger pulse output.
- `data_word_wr_en`: Enables writing trigger timing data.
- `data_word [31:0]`: Trigger timing data (lower/upper 32 bits).
- `data_buf_overflow`, `bad_cmd`: Error flags.

## Operation

### Command Types

- **SYNC_CH (`3'd1`):** Synchronize trigger across all DAC/ADC channels.
- **SET_LOCKOUT (`3'd2`):** Set minimum lockout time between triggers.
- **EXPECT_EXT_TRIG (`3'd3`):** Wait for a specified number of external triggers.
- **DELAY (`3'd4`):** Wait for a specified delay (in clock cycles).
- **FORCE_TRIG (`3'd5`):** Force a trigger immediately.
- **CANCEL (`3'd7`):** Cancel current wait or operation.

### Command Word Structure

- `[31:29]` - Command code (3 bits).
- `[28:0]` - Command value (29 bits).

#### SYNC_CH Command (`3'd1`)

No additional parameters. Sends an internal trigger pulse to all DAC/ADC channels to synchronize them once they are all ready (waiting for trigger).

#### SET_LOCKOUT Command (`3'd2`)

Sets the minimum lockout time between external triggers (ignore external triggers during this period) to the 29-bit value specified in the command word (in SPI clock cycles).

#### EXPECT_EXT_TRIG Command (`3'd3`)

Expect a specified number of external triggers before moving to the next command. The 29-bit command value specifies how many triggers to expect. If set to zero, the core will not wait for external triggers and will immediately return to IDLE state.

#### DELAY Command (`3'd4`)

Wait for a specified delay (in SPI clock cycles) before moving to the next command. The 29-bit command value specifies the delay duration. If set to zero, the core will not wait and will immediately return to IDLE state.

#### FORCE_TRIG Command (`3'd5`)

Forces an internal trigger pulse. This command does not wait for the DAC/ADC channels to be ready and can cause an unexpected trigger error.

#### CANCEL Command (`3'd7`)

Cancels the current wait or operation. If the core is waiting for a trigger or delay, it will immediately exit that state and return to IDLE. It is recommended to clear the command buffer before issuing a CANCEL command to ensure immediate cancellation.

### Trigger Timing Data

- On each trigger, two 32-bit words are written to the data buffer:
  - First word: Lower 32 bits of the trigger timer.
  - Second word: Upper 32 bits of the trigger timer.

### State Machine

- **IDLE:** Awaiting commands.
- **SYNC_CH:** Synchronize channels before triggering.
- **EXPECT_TRIG:** Wait for external triggers.
- **DELAY:** Wait for delay or lockout period.
- **ERROR:** Error state.

### Error Handling

- Invalid commands set `bad_cmd`.
- Data buffer overflow sets `data_buf_overflow`.
- Lockout values below minimum are rejected.

## Notes

- Trigger lockout prevents triggers from occurring too rapidly.
- Synchronization ensures all DAC/ADC channels are ready before triggering.
- Timing data enables precise event timestamping for downstream processing.
